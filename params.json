{"name":"Particle/Arduino RC Car","tagline":"code and step-by-step docs for controlling an RC car via Particle and Arduino boards","body":"## Particle/Arduino RC car project\r\n\r\nThis is my second real electronics project. I've always thought it would be fun to wire up a computer to an RC can and program it to drive around. Attempt number one involved sticking wires directly into the parallel port of a 386 PC and clipping the other ends onto the RC controller circuit board. It was programmed in QBasic. It worked! ...until it circuit board ran out of magic smoke:(\r\n\r\nAttempt number two will be a little more methodical and documented here!\r\n\r\n#### 1: Connect the RC car to the Arduino\r\n- Components required\r\n  - 1 RC car\r\n  - 1 [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/HomePage) (I have an [Uno](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/arduinoBoardUno) R2)\r\n  - 1 [Arduino motor shield](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoMotorShieldR3) (or build a circuit)\r\n  - 12 connector wires\r\n  - soldering equipment\r\n  - 1 breadboard\r\n\r\n- Wire things up\r\nI got lucky in finding [instructions](http://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1651494) to connect to the exact RC car I had purchased, but a little googling turned up a number of different examples.  Basically you need to connect the motor shield's power and ground to those of the RC car, then connect the drive pins on the shield to the motor output pins on the car's IC.\r\n- Test your soldering\r\n  - If the car still drives with the RC controller, you've probably succeeded in not breaking it!\r\n  - You can test your solders by connecting each of the IC wires to the car's power in turn. If the car's main power is more than a few volts you should use a resistor in the connection to protect the IC.  If anything doesn't work check your solders. This is also a good time to label the wires (F/B/L/R/Vcc/Grnd)\r\n\r\n- [Program the Arduino to drive your car](https://github.com/jasonpvp/particle-arduino-car/blob/master/src/step_1_arduino_to_car/drive_car_test_1.ino)\r\n\r\n- Connect the Arduino to your car\r\n  - Connect the motor car's Vcc (hot) and ground wires and the L/R and F/B to the power pins and drive pins of the motor shield\r\n \r\n- Test it out!\r\nWith the above program on your Arduino and the board wired to the car, the drive and steering motors should ramp up from 0 to 100% every few seconds.\r\n\r\n#### 2: Get the Particle board to talk to the Arduino\r\n\r\n#### 3: Program the Arduino to expose an API for driving the car via serial\r\n\r\n#### 4: Program the Particle board to expose a web interface for controlling the RC car\r\n\r\n#### 5: Program the Particle board to relay commands to the Arduino\r\n\r\n#### 6: Teach the Arduino to detect its environment...","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
