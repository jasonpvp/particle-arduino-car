I've always thought it would be fun to wire up a computer to an RC can and program it to drive around. Attempt number one involved sticking wires directly into the parallel port of a 386 PC and clipping the other ends onto the RC controller circuit board. It was programmed in QBasic. It worked! ...until it circuit board ran out of magic smoke:(\r\n\r\nAttempt number two will be a little more methodical and documented here!\r\n\r\n#### 1: Connect the RC car to the Arduino\r\n\r\n#### 2: Get the Particle board to talk to the Arduino\r\n\r\n#### 3: Program the Arduino to expose an API for driving the car via serial\r\n\r\n#### 4: Program the Particle board to expose a web interface for controlling the RC car\r\n\r\n#### 5: Program the Particle board to relay commands to the Arduino\r\n\r\n#### 6: Teach the Arduino to detect its environment...","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
